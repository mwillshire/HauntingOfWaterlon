# HauntingOfWaterlon
# All scripts are either pulled and cited from other sources as shown in the credits scene, or made by myself.
# Any scripts made by myself are strictly usable by only myself, Michael Willshire. 
# I believe that if you want to make games, then you should build your own script library.
# You should only look for scripts if you are having trouble making something and really should only be the part of the script that you need.
